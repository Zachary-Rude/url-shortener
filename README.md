# **URL Shortener**

URL Shortener is a functional URL shortener, written in jQuery.

This URL shortener uses the API for [Bit.ly][1], so URLs can be shortened on the _client-side_ only, without Node.js. As a bonus, I don't have to buy a custom domain!

## **Check it Out**

URL Shortener is available online at https://url-shortener.zacharyrude.repl.co/.
